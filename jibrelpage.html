    <strong>Final step of this html Assignment</strong> <!--Normally, you want all text to be within a div or paragraph or some other element type that isn't just a treatment type... So, you've made this line <strong> which makes it bold, but the browser has to guess that you want this to be a paragraph. Instead you should tell it explicitly that it is a paragraph, so put <p> around it.-->
