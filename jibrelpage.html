<!DOCTYPE html><!--Mark's comment: Overall, this has numerous basic errors in it and I'm concerned that you aren't devoting the proper amount of time and care for this course to work. Please take the time to read through the tutorials on w3schools carefully. For HTML and for CSS, you want to read at least the first six pages. https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp and https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp You also want to use the debug panel in VSCode and resolve any problems before submitting the work. (Go to View->Appearance->Show Panel) And, finally, your whole team should be checking each others' work before submitting, which means coordinating days before the deadline.-->
